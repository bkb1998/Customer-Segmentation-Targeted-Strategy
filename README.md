### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Handled missing values in **Gender, ProductStyle, ProductColor**.  
- Created features: **PurchaseFrequency, TotalSpend, DiscountMargin, ProfitMargin, Age, DistinctProducts**.  

### 2. Customer Segmentation (K-Means)  
- Used **Elbow method & Silhouette score** to determine optimal clusters.  
- Findings:

  - **Cluster 0**
    - Higher total spend & purchase frequency compared to other groups.
    - Strong representation from Australia, Canada, and UK.
    - Customers purchase a broader range of products (diverse interests). 
  - **Cluster 1**
    - Lower spending & purchase frequency, more targeted purchases.
    - Dominated by regions like Southwest, Northwest, and France.
    - Tend to focus on specific products rather than variety.  

### 3. Repeat Purchase Prediction (Decision Tree)  
- Model achieved ~89% accuracy in predicting repeat buyers.
- Discounts & product variety are key drivers of loyalty.
- Strong precision in identifying non-repeat customers â†’ useful for targeted retention campaigns. 

### 4. Factors Influencing Purchase (Gradient Boosting)

- Target: **OrderQuantity**  
- Evaluation: MAE = 0.14 | RÂ² = 0.65  
- Top drivers: **Discount Price, PriceDiscountRatio, ProductPrice, DiscountEffectiveness**.
- Discount Price is the strongest factor influencing order quantity.
- Price-to-Discount Ratio and Discount Effectiveness significantly affect purchase decisions.
- Demographics (age, income) play a smaller but measurable role.

### 5. Forecasting Sales & Profit (ARIMA)  
- Forecast horizon: **12 months**
- **Bikes**:: Strong, consistent growth â€” should remain a key focus.
- **Accessories**: Stable sales, but profit volatility suggests pricing strategy adjustments.
- **Clothing**: Emerging growth opportunity â€” requires inventory scaling & targeted marketing.
- Key Insight:  
  - Forecasting supports proactive inventory planning and category-specific marketing strategies for the next 12 months.
